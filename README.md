1.First step is data collection

• I used Kaggle for it - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset)

2.Load and explore your dataset.

•Understand the features and labels.

•Clean the data—handle missing values, outliers, and ensure proper formatting.

•Normalize or standardize features if needed.

•Split data into training and testing sets.

3.Extract relevant features

•Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA if needed.

•Select important features that contribute most to classification.

4.Choosing & Training a Basic Model

•Using deep learning (RNN based approach) for this project.

5.Evaluate Model's accuracy

•Using Accuracy Metric.

6.Final Testing and presentation

•Shown RMSE value and top 5 recommended movies for a sample user based on model predictions.
